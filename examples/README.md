# Developer's Guide
The best way to contribute to Isfahan is by starting with the example project provided by the library. The following assumes you have completed installation:

* Change into the examples directory: `cd Isfahan/examples`
* Run `./run.sh` (requires Python) which performs the next two steps:
* Run `gulp watch &` to rebuild as files are modified (& runs in background)
* Point a webserver to the examples directory, e.g. SimpleHTTPServer: `python -m SimpleHTTPServer`
* Point your browser to: `<your-browser> localhost:8000`
